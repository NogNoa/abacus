Abacus is only memory. Processor emulation is seperated
procesor send the abacus cells push and pull commands with force
Cells can't manage carry and borrow themsleves
they return to the processor three states
    Middle - when the cell finish the command not a state not full or empty
    End - when the cell finish the command at the expected end-state (full for push, empty for pull)
    fail - The command didn't move even one beed since the cell was allready in an end-state
Optionaly With end and the two others it also returns the remaining force.
The procesor need to use the memory to remember the operands
